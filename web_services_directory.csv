Primarily working in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and New York City, we are all volunteers producing digital maps, oral history work, film, murals, and community events. Working with a number of community partners and in solidarity with numerous housing movements, we study and visualize new entanglements of global capital, real estate, technocapitalism, and political economy. Our narrative oral history and video work centers the displacement of people and complex social worlds, but also modes of resistance. Maintaining antiracist and feminist analyses as well as decolonial methodology, the project creates tools and disseminates data contributing to collective resistance and movement building.",Public,Stanford,"{""http://schema.org/url"":""https://antievictionmap.com//""}",1da01b9b-4bfb-48fc-8444-ef61cab82bef,stanford-1da01b9b-4bfb-48fc-8444-ef61cab82bef,Mixed,2020-07-09T00:03:08Z,Web Application,English,Service,San Francisco Tenants Union,"['Eviction', 'Housing']",2020,['2020'],['United States'],"ENVELOPE(-125.102, -66.134, 50.1019992, 23.9979992)",2020,1,

We initially began in North America and have spread increasingly worldwide, and new areas are added regularly. This tool is not meant to be an official, legal, or archival resource. It is instead a broadly researched and crowdsourced body of information. It is meant to encourage education and engagement on topics of Indigenous landâ€”particularly, where you are located. Native Land brings about discussions of colonization, land rights, language, and Indigenous history tied to our personal histories. We hope this guide makes you, the reader, want to know about the land you live on.",Public,Stanford,"{""http://schema.org/url"":""https://native-land.ca/""}",3240896a-2741-4f6c-b807-75b770e2d31b,stanford-3240896a-2741-4f6c-b807-75b770e2d31b,Mixed,2020-07-09T00:03:08Z,Web Application,English,Service,Native Land Digital,"['Territory acknowledgement', 'Indigenous peoples']",2020,['2020'],['Earth (Planet)'],"ENVELOPE(-180, 180, 90, -90)",2020,1,"['Temprano, Victor G.']"
